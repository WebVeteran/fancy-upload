Fancy Upload is a form widget that makes it appear as if
we've styled the 'browse...' button and file name field 
with only CSS. Since I did not specify any widths in pixels,
we will have a nice cross browser solution. Then by adding
some javascript we have total control of the file name,
and even add an icon. And it degrades nicely if javascript
is not available.
